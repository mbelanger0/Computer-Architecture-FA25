This repository contains coursework and projects for the Olin College of Engineering ENGR3410 Computer Architecture course taught by Brad Minch.

An FPGA development board, designed by Brad, is used throughout the course. It is designed using an Lattice Semiconductor iCE40UP5K and uses the OSS CAD Suite of tools to compile code and upload to the board.
